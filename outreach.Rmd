Dr. Carlson and I participated in an initiative led by [Dr. Alyson Santoro](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/santoro/alyson/) and the Smithsonian to develop content for the [Smithsonian Ocean Portal](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/microbes
). The motivation of the portal was to find new ways of communicate microbial ocean science to the public. Check out the short film by filmaker [Brendan Byrne](https://vimeo.com/brendansbyrne) that describes our work!

 [Dr. Kelsey Bisson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8FrNCE0AAAAJ&hl=en) led a project funded by the [National Academies Keck Futures Initiative](http://www.nasonline.org/programs/keck-futures-initiative/) that wove together the strengths of art and science. She put together a team of four artists, [Celia Jacobs](http://www.celiaj.com), [Dustin Hayes](http://lvl3official.com/walter-etc/), and [Gad Girling](https://gadgirling.myportfolio.com/projects), who worked to bring oceanography to the public eye through their mediums of art, music, photography, writing, and film.
